Solutions to leetcode problems using python3.

Problems under **'/leetcode-blind-75'** are my primary notes for solving [Neetcode 75](https://neetcode.io/). The neetcode website is very useful for beginners, provding video solutions step by step which gives me a clue on how to solve such problems. 

After completing the problem list several times, now I am able to solve more problems on Leetcode by myself.<br/>
I'll keep tracking my practice process here ðŸ˜Š.
