Solutions to leetcode problems using python3.

Problems under [**'/leetcode-blind-75'**](https://github.com/leahlyu22/leetcode-python-practice/blob/main/leetcode-blind-75/Leetcode-Blind-75%20ccc6226b2ee04586b7a6433806fe92f8.md) are my primary notes for solving [Neetcode 75](https://neetcode.io/). The neetcode website is very useful for beginners, provding video solutions step by step which gives me a clue on how to solve such problems. 

After completing the problem list several times, now I am able to solve more problems on Leetcode by myself.<br/>
I'll keep tracking my practice process here ðŸ˜Š.
